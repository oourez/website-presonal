    </h2>
    I started that so-called “game” experiment to discover that it was one of the most happy decisions I was to make.

    The cover of the game carried a seemingly evil man, painted in an eye-catching heroic form, showing signs of intense anger and threat on his face. That game attracted me because of the developer at first and its reputation. But with each loading screen I was staring with the cover painting, and it was my gateway to another world. I always tried to think about who painted that wonderful drawing, what he was thinking, and how he wanted the hero "Arthur Morgan" to appear.
    With a blood-colored background, a batter that carries gang members on their horses wandering in the old American West, behind them Arthur in large size, he pointed his gun at you, everyone who approaches his gang, who is also his family.

With the stars of the American flag below to give a sense of space and time to this image that looks like a “screenshot from inside Arthur’s brain” itself, or a shot from one of its nightmares! With the bright yellow sunlight behind covering all the colors of the drawing as if it portends the sunrise of civilized society, which in turn will completely reject the behavior of Arthur and his barbaric gang.
I had quit writing about games in this era when I tried Red dead redemption 2 but nothing inside me is broken after my experience ended. I wasn’t a critic, nor a poet at the time but I would wake up every morning that cold winter to listen to the peep of birds around me, look at the sky in a state of passion and think about my favorite game now.

That fucking forced me to write poetry in it, it forced me to wear the critic’s cloak again, and that was back.
I can no longer try a video game or watch a movie without thinking about criticizing it, or writing about it. I can’t watch Dune, for example, without thinking about how many articles I can write about the beauty of photography in it, and the design of the world. I found psychological warmth back in the arms of my gaming console thanks to one game made specifically to prove to everyone that video games are art, not entertainment. An art that may be purposeful if he wants to make it, it may make you sad and throw you crying, or lift your spirits and make you bright with your adrenaline-driven smile to dress on your irse face.
The passion I lost when I was older returned to me, and this was reflected in most aspects of my life by making me can’t stand the things I don’t do passionately. I wish you all find the flames of your passion, and learn the meaning of that passion for experience.
